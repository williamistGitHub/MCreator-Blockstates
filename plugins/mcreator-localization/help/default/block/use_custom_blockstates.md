When enabled, you can add custom blockstates to your block.

A good deciding factor on whether or not to use blockstates for something is if it should be possible to hold separately in your inventory.
If it should, make a separate block instead.

Vanilla uses blockstates for the following (not limited to):
 * Waterlogged
 * Block direction
 * Is powered by redstone
 * Crop age
 * Composter level

If your block needs anything similar to the above, use blockstates.
